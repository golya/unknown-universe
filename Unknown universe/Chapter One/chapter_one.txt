The dawn

  "Did you see that?" Nemere asked passionately then glanced at her with wonder.
  "Not really," said Aysun, standing on the bank of the Danube, watching how the colours of the dawn painted the basilica of Esztergom.
  "Come on," said Nemere. "Why do not you believe in me? Just look, it will now succeed." He tried to concentrate to surface of the water and after a while, little area of water started to freez. Aysun seemed not to watch him just she felt good in the imminent summer morning.
  "Aysun, how I yearn for your attention and you ignoring me?" Nemere stood up and walked away from the bank.
  "Oh Dear, I am sorry, but I enjoy this dawn, this building is so beautiful, isn't it. Come back I will be watching you, I promise." Aysun grab his arm and walked back together. The water started to freez again and the girl could not belive in her eyes.
