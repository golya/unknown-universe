  "Aysun, how I yearn for your attention and you ignoring me?" Nemere stood up and walked away from the bank.
  "Oh Dear, I am sorry, but I enjoy this dawn, this building is so beautiful, isn't it. Come back I will be watching you, I promise." Aysun grab his arm and walked back together. The water started to freez again and the girl could not belive in her eyes.
